Applied Machine Learning Projects

## Project 1 - Linear Regression and Logical Regression
Implement two ML models—Linear regression, Logistic regression (with gradient descent)—and provide analysis on these two models on two distinct datasets.

## Project 2 - Classification of Image Data with MultilayerPerceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks
Implement a multilayer perceptron from scratch, and use it to classify image data. One of the goals is to implement a basic neural network and its training algorithm from scratch and get hands-on experience with important decisions that you have to make while training these models. You will also have a chance to experiment with convolutional neural networks and use pre-trained versions of them to perform image classification.

## Project 3 - Classification of Textual Data
Implement Naive Bayes from scratch and BERT with pertained weights through package (fine tuning could be optional component), and compare these two algorithms on the IMDB review dataset. The goal is to gain experience implementing machine learning algorithm from scratch and running the modern deep learning libraries, and getting hands-on experience comparing their performances on the real-world textual dataset.
